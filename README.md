# Fullstack Developer Hiring – Coding Assignment

## Real-Time Trading Platform (Testnet)

### Objective

Build a full-stack real-time trading platform that demonstrates:
- Backend architecture (message-driven, async execution)
- Real-time data handling (WebSocket streams)
- Frontend engineering (trading UI, charts, state management)
- System design (separation of concerns, scalability)

This assignment evaluates your understanding of distributed systems, not just code output. You will be asked to explain architectural decisions during the interview.

**Important:** This is a testnet assignment for evaluation purposes only. It is not a real trading system and should not be used with real funds or production exchanges.

---

## Deadline

**Sunday, December 21, 2025 at 11:59 PM**

Submit via GitHub Classroom before the deadline. Late submissions will not be accepted.

---

- Provide GitHub repo + live URLs

---

## Submission Method

- Submit via GitHub Classroom
- Repository must be a monorepo containing both backend and frontend
- Both applications must be deployable from the same repository

---

## System Architecture Overview

Your system must follow this architecture pattern:

```
Frontend → API Gateway (JWT auth) → Redis (command bus) → Order Execution
                                                              ↓
Frontend ← WebSocket ← Event Service (subscribes to Redis) ← Order Events
```

**Key principles:**
1. API Gateway does not execute orders directly
2. Orders are published to Redis as commands
3. A separate service consumes Redis events and executes orders
4. Order events flow back through Redis → Event Service → Frontend
5. All order commands and events are logged to a database

---

## Milestone 1: Trade Panel (Core Evaluation)

### Backend Requirements

#### 1. Authentication System

Implement:
- `POST /auth/register`
  - Accepts: `{ email, password, binanceApiKey, binanceSecretKey }`
  - Stores user with hashed password (bcrypt)
  - Stores Binance keys securely (encrypted in DB)
  - Returns JWT token

- `POST /auth/login`
  - Accepts: `{ email, password }`
  - Validates credentials
  - Returns: `{ token, user: { id, email } }`

- JWT middleware for protected routes
- All trading endpoints require valid JWT

#### 2. API Gateway - Order Endpoints

Implement in your Express.js API Gateway:

- `POST /api/trading/orders`
  - **Request:**
    ```json
    {
      "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
      "side": "BUY" | "SELL",
      "type": "MARKET",
      "quantity": 0.001
    }
    ```
  - **Flow:**
    1. Validate JWT token
    2. Extract user ID from token
    3. Validate request body
    4. **Publish command to Redis** (do NOT call Binance directly)
    5. Return: `{ orderId, status: "PENDING" }`

  - **Redis command format:**
    ```
    Channel: commands:order:submit
    Message: {
      "orderId": "uuid",
      "userId": "user-id-from-token",
      "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
      "side": "BUY",
      "type": "MARKET",
      "quantity": 0.001,
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
    ```

- `GET /api/trading/orders`
  - Returns all orders for authenticated user
  - Fetch from database (orders logged by Event Service)

- `GET /api/trading/positions`
  - Returns current positions for authenticated user
  - Calculate from filled orders

#### 3. Order Execution Service (Separate Service)

Create a separate service/process that:

1. **Subscribes to Redis:**
   - Channel: `commands:order:submit`
   - Consumes order commands

2. **Executes orders:**
   - For each command:
     - Extract user's Binance API keys from database
     - Call Binance Testnet REST API to place order
     - Handle success/failure

3. **Publishes events to Redis:**
   - Channel: `events:order:status`
   - Message format:
     ```json
     {
       "orderId": "uuid",
       "userId": "user-id",
       "status": "FILLED" | "REJECTED" | "PARTIALLY_FILLED",
       "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
       "side": "BUY",
       "quantity": 0.001,
       "price": 67200.12,
       "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
     }
     ```

4. **Logs to database:**
   - Store all order commands in `order_commands` table
   - Store all order events in `order_events` table
   - Schema:
     ```sql
     order_commands:
       id, userId, orderId, symbol, side, type, quantity, status, createdAt
     
     order_events:
       id, orderId, userId, status, price, quantity, timestamp, createdAt
     ```

#### 4. Event Broadcasting Service (Separate Service)

Create another service that:

1. **Subscribes to Redis events:**
   - Channel: `events:order:status`

2. **Broadcasts to frontend via WebSocket:**
   - Maintain WebSocket connections per user
   - When order event received, broadcast to user's WebSocket
   - Message format:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "ORDER_UPDATE",
       "data": {
         "orderId": "uuid",
         "status": "FILLED",
         "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
         "price": 67200.12
       }
     }
     ```

3. **WebSocket endpoint:**
   - `ws://your-backend/prices`
   - Requires JWT token in connection handshake
   - Associate WebSocket with user ID

### Frontend Requirements

#### Design Language

Follow the provided trading platform design structure exactly. The UI should match the reference design in:
- Layout structure (header, left panel for order entry, right panel for chart/positions)
- Color scheme and styling
- Component placement and spacing
- Typography and visual hierarchy
- Responsive breakpoints

Use Tailwind CSS for styling to match the design system.

#### 1. Login & Register Pages

- **Login Page:**
  - Email + password form
  - Store JWT token securely (explain your storage strategy)
  - Redirect to trade panel on success
  - Match the design language

- **Register Page:**
  - Form fields:
    - Email
    - Password
    - Binance API Key (Testnet)
    - Binance Secret Key (Testnet)
  - On submit, call `/auth/register`
  - Auto-login after registration
  - Match the design language

#### 2. Trade Panel UI

Build a trading interface matching the provided design:

- **Header Section:**
  - Logo/branding
  - User profile indicator
  - Trading status indicator
  - Theme toggle (if applicable)

- **Left Panel - Order Entry:**
  - Symbol selector (dropdown/search)
  - Buy/Sell tabs
  - Order type selector (Market, Limit, Stop Market)
  - Quantity input field
  - Price input (for limit orders)
  - Total calculation display
  - Available balance display
  - Place order button
  - Account information section (margin ratio, maintenance margin, etc.)

- **Right Panel - Chart & Positions:**
  - Trading pair display
  - Current price with change indicator
  - **Candlestick Chart (MANDATORY for Fullstack):**
    - Use `lightweight-charts` library
    - Fetch historical candles from Binance Testnet
    - Update chart with real-time data via WebSocket
    - Chart must update smoothly without full re-renders
    - Timeframe selector (1m, 5m, 1h, 1d, 1w)
    - **Symbol selection from frontend must automatically update the chart**
    - When user changes symbol in the symbol selector, the chart should:
      - Fetch new historical data for the selected symbol
      - Update WebSocket subscription to new symbol
      - Update chart display without page reload
  - Positions/Orders/Trades table:
    - Tabs for Positions, Orders, Trades
    - Table columns: Transaction, Size, Entry price, Market price, Realized PnL, Unrealized PnL
    - Real-time updates via WebSocket
    - Status indicators with appropriate colors

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Works on desktop, tablet, mobile
  - Chart should be responsive
  - Layout adapts to screen size while maintaining design integrity
